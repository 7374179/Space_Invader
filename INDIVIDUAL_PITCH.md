# Individual Pitch


### Yeju Jung (Audio, Barrier, Stopwatch, and GameRestart class)
As the developer in charge of the Audio, Barrier, BarrierManager, and GameRestart classes, my responsibilities include managing the barriers that protect the player's spaceship from the aliens' bullets, creating and managing the barriers in the game, including positioning, destruction, and regeneration. Furthermore, I have created a Stopwatch class that serves the purpose of timing and updating the game window. Additionally, I have developed a class responsible for implementing the sound effects of the game, as well as a restart button to be displayed after the player dies.

### Bingdi Zhou (Invader, InvaderManager, Sprite, Password, DatabaseHandler, and GameStateManager class)
As a developer of the Invader class and Invader Manager class, I will implement the Invader class which will represent individual invaders in the game and the InvaderManager class which will manage the collection of invaders and provide methods for adding, removing, and updating their properties. I have implemented a MongoDB inside our game to be able to track the gamestatus and the leaderboard.

### Tae Hyung Lee (Player, Keyboard, PlayerTest, InvaderTest, BarrierTest class)
As the designated as Player, Keyboard, PlayerTest, InvaderTest, BarrierTest class for the Java project, I will create an engaging and visually appealing representation of the player while ensuring that the game mechanics are functioning smoothly through rigorous testing and debugging. By utilizing my expertise in both art and programming, I aim to deliver a seamless gaming experience for all players to be able to control the spaceship using keyboard. Lastly, I have wrote test classes for Player, Invader, and Barrier(Three main classes) to check if they are funtioning properly.

### All 4 team-members tasks (Windows)

The Window class is responsible for painting the game window with its graphical components. The class sets up graphical components such as player, invaders, missiles, barriers, and game messages. The code initializes various objects such as InvaderManager, MissilePlayer, MissileInvader1, MissileInvader2, MissileInvader3, and Barrier. It also handles various game states such as paused, game over, and ranking board. It implements various listeners such as KeyListener, ActionListener, and MouseAdapter. The code also saves and loads the game state.
