# Project Pitch


## 1. A one-liner (exactly 1 sentence) that describes your project.


The objective of our project is to create a variation of the video game Space Invaders.


## 2. Outline


We have chosen to create the "Space Invader" project, in which the player will command a spaceship that can move around inside a window and fire missiles that can destroy the invader spacecrafts. In order to designate and integrate the sprites inside the GUI, we would first create a player with a green square and invaders with a red circle. As this project progresses, we'll strive to improve their appearance.
In this game, a player will control one invader spaceship, and numerous other invader spaceships will move automatically left and right and back and forth. Additionally, they fire missiles at one another, therefore they ought to be able to avoid damage by moving towards different directions. The game will preserve the standard status of the invaders, barriers, and missiles as a data state in a file so that it can always utilize the same procedure whenever a player starts a new game. Using statistics that the data structure keeps track of, a spacecraft firing missiles and a group of invaders will be added and removed from the screen.


## 3. Communication policies


We will meet in person every Tuesday at 1:30pm for roughly 2 hours and use Discord the group chat to communicate with each other. We made rules that we will respond in 24 hours to the questions or requests that are made through Discord.
